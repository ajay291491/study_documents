# * Install Docker
# You can install Docker by install below two packages 
# | 
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# rpm -qa| grep -i docker
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# rpm -qa| grep -i docker
# | docker-ce-cli-18.09.6-3.el7.x86_64
# | docker-ce-18.09.1-3.el7.x86_64
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]#
# | 
#
# * Verify the installation 
# You can verify the instllation of docker server and client by running below command 
# | 
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# docker version
# | Client:
# |  Version:           18.09.6
# |  API version:       1.39
# |  Go version:        go1.10.8

# |
# | Server: Docker Engine - Community
# |  Engine:
# |   Version:          18.09.1

# |   Go version:       go1.10.6

# * How to start a container 
# To start a container you will need to run the 'docker run' command. When you start a container there are few steps happens in the background 
#
# Syntax : docker run <image_name>
#
# Below are few steps which is outlined in the chronological order while running a docker run command 
#
# 1. When you run the command docker client contacts the docker server for image location
# 2. Then Docker server verifies the image in its cache, if its available it helps to start the image from the cache
# 3. Incase there is no cache available then it forwards the requst to container image repository "Docker Hub'
# 4. It checks for the image in the docker hub and then pulls that image int0 local repository or cache 
# 5. Then docker client will start the container from the image which has downloaded.
#
# Example : Below is an example to start a 'hello-world' program. 
#
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# docker run hello-world
# |
# | Hello from Docker!
# | This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
# |
# | To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
# |  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
# |  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
# |     (amd64)
# |  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
# |     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
# |  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
# |     to your terminal.
# |
# | To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
# |  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
# |
# | Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
# |  https://hub.docker.com/

#
#
# * What happens when you install docker container
# When you install docker container there will be a Linux virtual machine gets installed in the background which acts as the Docker Server
# You can see docker server operating system details in the 'docker version' command to verify this. 
# Any container process which runs will be from this container, this will be true regardless the underlying OS is Linux, Windows or Mac.
#
# Docker installation layering is done like below. 
# - Underlying Operating system (Windows / Linux / Mac)
# - Docker Server Linux VM gets created on top of the OS 
# - Docker contaner process running inside the Docker Server Linux VM
#
# NOTE : Udemy Detailed Tutorial on the Docker layers and how its works

#
#
# * What is a Docker Image and container
# Docker image is a collection of software and filesystem snapshot along with a set of steps which can be used to startup a container.
# Container is a set of process which spins up with the instruction given from the docker images
# 
# NOTE : Below udemy tutorial gives a complete details about container image. 
# https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/11436632?start=422#bookmarks 
#
# 
# * What is namespacing and cgroups
# namespacing - namespacing a Linux feature which allows to isolate resourse per processs or group of process 
# cgroups     - cgroups also a Linux feature which limit the amount of resources used per process

#  Chapter 02 - Manipulating a docker Container
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * Executing commands in Container 
# When you are running a command insider a docker container that will work only if that contaner image contains that commands embedded inside. 
# If the container image is not embedded with the commands then the command won't work 
#
# Examples : Below are two instances where the same command behave in different while executing in two different containers
#
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# docker run hello-world uptime
# | docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"uptime\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown.
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# docker run busybox uptime
# |  23:26:30 up  1:53,  0 users,  load average: 0.07, 0.02, 0.01
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# 
#
# Note : Here uptime command was not embedded in the 'hello-world' image where its available in 'busybox' 
#
# To run a command in a docker container you will need to follow below syntax 
#
# syntax : docker run <image> <command>
#
# * ps command
# This command can be used to find the list of running continers. 
# When you add '--all' parameter to the command then its going to give the details about all the commands ran in the past
#
# Syntax : docker ps 
#        : docker ps --all
#
# Example : Running the command to show currently running containers
#
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# docker ps 
# | CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
# | 3d488796f6ab        busybox             "top"               6 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds                            optimistic_mahavira
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# 
#
# Example : Running the command to show the history of all containers 
#
# | [root@dockerstation01 ~]# docker ps --all
# | CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
