# Chapter 01 : Shell Scripting 
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * Shell scripting
# shell scripting can be used to automate a chain of commands with a logical linking into it. 
# Shell scripting can be useful in automating small scale automations when it goes to complex automation tasks where you need multi dimensional array then perl or python will be a better alternative 
# In this chapeter you will see only a minimal notes from shell scripting since expereinced in it . 
#
# * Variable representation 
# VAR_1 = 'TEST ONE'  	=> This can be used to represent the string as it is TEST ONE
# VAR_2 = "$TEST_2"   	=> This will process the value of the variable $TEST_2 and will give an output
# VAR_3 = '$1'		=> This will only give the output as $1
# VAR_4 = "$1"		=> This will process the value of the $1 and provide 
# 
# * Few tips 
# unset				=> This will remove the value of a variable , Example : unset $VAR_2
# /etc/profile.d/coloursi*.sh	=> This will set the colors for various commands and file types
# /etc/profile			=> This is where we can cutomize the environment variables 
# ~/.bash.profile		=> This is where you can custom your shell related environment variable 
# $PS1				=> This variable indicates how your landing shell should look like.
#
# $ let X=10+2+7		=> You can use let also while doing arithamatic calculation
# eho $X
# echo $((10+2+7))		=> You can use paramethesis along with 
#
# String Comparison and intiger comparison in conditionals 
#
# * String manupulation 
# st = "1234567"
# echo ${#st}  		=> This will print length of the string which is "7"
# echo ${st:3} 		=> This will print string from the 3rd position which is 4567
# echo ${st:3:5} 	=> This will print string from 3rd position to 5th which 3, 4, 5
#
# NOTE : For a detailed study on shell scripting look at the SA3 chapter 11 and 12.
