# Ansible is a configuration management tool which is supported by Redhat. 
# It can manage several system resource remotely according to playbook which is defined. 
# Playbooks are are promises which written in ansible and language used for writing such promise is "YAML".
# Ansible works on top of the SSH keys, that means code will be deployed on the ssh trusted clients. 
# 
# Code language : YAML
#
# Code deployment method : PUSH
# Compare to its other competetors such puppet and cfengine, ansible uses a push method 
# That means master will push codes to clients, rather than clients pulls code from master
#
# Agentless nature : 
# Ansible do not have a agent or daemon running on the client side, master will take care of pushing the policy on client side
# If you have the ansible master node key trusted and added to the authorized_keys file in the client, then master node will be able to connect to the client. 
#
# Configuration file : /etc/ansible/ansible.conf
# Ansisble configuration file is the key file which holds information about what should be looked at where for ansible to work
# Any customarization to the default configuration can be made in this config files
# Few sample configuration it holds are hostfile, user etc 
#
# Inventory file : /etc/ansible/hosts 
# This is the file in which ansible keeps its inventory and any node which managed by ansible must be added here. 
#
# Connectivity : Testing client connection using modules
# Once you have added the master node key to the client, then you can do the basic connection test as below 
#
# #
# # [root@ansiblemaster01 ~]# ansible clientnode02.svr.apac.sathsang.net -m command -a uptime
# # clientnode02.svr.apac.sathsang.net | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
# #  04:53:16 up 4 days,  7:03,  2 users,  load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.05
# # [root@ansiblemaster01 ~]# 
# #
#
# #
# # root@ansiblemaster01 ~]# ansible clientnode02.svr.apac.sathsang.net -m ping
# # clientnode02.svr.apac.sathsang.net | SUCCESS => {
# #   "changed": false, 
# #   "ping": "pong"
# # }
# # [root@ansiblemaster01 ~]# 
# #
#
# Note : When you are calling a module you will need to use "-m" string and followed by "module name".
#      : When you are calling a atribute within the module you can use "-a" followed by the attribute.
