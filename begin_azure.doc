#                          Chapter 01 - Describe Cloud Computing 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * What is Cloud Computing 
# Cloud computing is the delivery of services including compute, storage, database, networking, software, analytics and intelligence over the internet. 
# This makes the resource and compute availbility faster and you are paying only for what you use. 
# This way you will need to look into only your application and business problem to solve and cloud provider will look after arranging the resources and compute power needed for their customer. 
#
# * Different types of infrastructure hosting models 
# Below are the types infrastructure hosting services available and responsilbity is mentioned below 
#
# - On-Prem : In this model customer takes heavy lifting of managing everything required for an application to be run by hilself.
#   Customer Responsibility : Datacenter, hardware or servers, operating system, networking, storage, network security,i application, user authentication & Governance, information & data 
#
# - IAAS    : A virtualized computing environment devliverd by provider which can have serevsr, network and software 
#   Cloud provider : Datacenter, hardware or servers, storage, networking
#   Customer       : Operating system, application, network security, user authentication and Governance, information & data
#
# - PAAS    : A computing platform whic contains operating system and all other underlying services to host an application by a provider. 
#   Cloud Provider : Datacenter, hardware or servers, storage, networking, operating system
#   Customer       : Application, network security, user authtication & Goverannce, information & data
#
# - SAAS    : An application delivered over the internet by a provider. 
#   Cloud Provider : Datacenter, hardware or servers, storage, networking, network security, operating system, application 
#   Customer       : User Authentication and Governance, information and data 
#
# * Different types of cloud
# There are mainly three types of cloud services available 
#
# - Private Cloud : This is the service offered over internet or private network which is not open for general public. 
# - Public Cloud  : This is the service offered over the internet whis is publically accessible for anyone who want to purchase them. 
# - Hybrid Cloud  : A cloud that combines public and private cloud together by technology and also allows data and application to be shared between them.
#
# * Cloud pricing 
# Cloud pricing can vary based on different things such as 
# - Operational Cost 
# - Storage Cost 
# - backup Cost 
# - network (input and output)
# - logs & monitor
# - many other facts 
#
# * Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
# TCO is the total cost of running the service which includes the cost of purchase of servers, software, service to operate cost such as data center, utility bill and employee salary 
#
# * How to reduce cost in Cloud 
# - autoscaling 
# 
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                          Chapter 02 - Azure Architectural Components
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * Regions  & Availability zones
# Region is a group of data centers deployed in multiple avilability zones within a single geographical location. 
# Azure offers more than 60 region world wide and it is the largest cloud provider by most number of regions 
# Each region will have a minimum 3 AZs inter connected with high performance network with round trip less than 2ms. 
#
# More Details : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview
#
# * Region pair & Cross region replication
# To recover customer data and service from multiple AZ or a wider region outage Azure provides a cross region replication architecture. 
# Some services use cross region replication by default using the advantage of services like Azure geo-redudant storage ()GRS) etc. 
# But some services do not have the cross region replication model available, in that case customer must build services to enable cross region replication. 
# To enable cross region replication azure uses regional replication pairs, please go through below link to understand more about the cross region replication and region pais 
#
# Reference : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure
#
# * Sovereign Regions 
# Certain regions are dedicated to specific soverign entities. Although all regions are azure, these soverign regions are isolated from other azure regions. 
# These regions are not necessarily managed by Microsoft, they may be restricted to certain customers. 
#
# Example - China, US Goverment 
#
# * Resources 
# Any virtual machines, storage, network, database or any other component helps to host your service running is a resource in azure 
#
#
# * Resource Groups
# Resource Groups are logical collection of resources which are similar in nature, You can have resources from multiple regions to be part of the same resource group. 
# For data privacy reasons data for the resource group has to be in specific region. 
# You have have virtual machine, storage, network, lb and data base etc as part of the same resource group 
#
# * Subscription 
# subscription logically associate user accounts with the resources that they create. 
# Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources that it can create and use. 
# Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, and projects.
# Subscriptions the way to manage billing, you can have one subscription or more than one based on your requirement for your company. 
# All resources consumed by a subscription will be billed by the owner of the subscription. 
# For example you can create subscription by environments like dev, test and prod or create with respect to teams, line of business or according to clients 
#
# Reference : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-an-azure-account/4-multiple-subscriptions
#
# * Management Group 
# Azure management groups are a way to organize subscriptions, it helps you to organize subscriptions and apply controls and governance on them. 
# All subscriptions under the management group will inherit the controls applied to the management group. 
# You can also have nested management groups under one another to have controls applied in various levels 
#
# Reference : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/azure-management-groups-now-in-general-availability/
#
# * Azure Management level and Heirarchy 
#
#              	   	          Management Group
#                       	        |
#    	         Subscription 1         |         Subscription 2

# * Network Security Services 
# 
# - DDos Protection
# - Azure Firewall 
# - Network Security group
# - Private Link
#
# * Public and Private endpoints
# Azure provides both Public endpoint and private endpoint options. 
# 
# Public endpoints gives mainly three options 
# - Allow access from everywhere in network 
# - Allow access from specific Vnet 
# - Disable Public Access and use Private endpoint 
#
# Private endpoints are created to securely enable a connection between one endpoint to another endpoints, so that resources can communicate each other in a 1:1 routing. 
# A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. 
# This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service that's powered by Azure Private Link. 
# By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.
#
# Refer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview

#                          Chapter 04 - Azure Storage  
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Azure has several storage options, starting from object storage BLOB to NAS and SAN, please find the details below. 
#
# * Azure Storage Accounts
# Storage accounts has mainly 4 options 
# - Azure Blobs container : This is the object storage like S3 in AWS which accessible via HTTP / HTTPS across the globe
# - Azure Files 	  : used for managed fils shares using SMB / NFS protocol / Azure Files REST API which is accessible from across the world.
# - Queue Storage : This is the Queue service like aws SQS used for passing anynchrouns message between azure services. 
# - Table Storage : Table storage is part of the Azure Cosmos DB which is available for hosting No SQL database use cases
#
# * Other Storage Types
# - Disk Storage  : This is block storage which can be used to store data in a VM which do not need to be accessed central from multiple services 
# - Azure Netapp  : Azure netapp files is used for high performance storage requirements where NAS can be used 
# - Azure Elastic SAN 	 : This is used for large scale data requirement which required high intenisty IO operation with the cloud HA and reliability. 
#
# * Storage authorization options 
#
# Azure provided below aithorization services to access the storage accounts 
#
# - Azure active directory (Azure AD) integration for blobs, queues and table data. 
# - Azure AD authorization over SMB for Azure files

#
# - Encyption at rest 
# You can use either microsoft managed keys (MMK) customer managed keys (CMK)
#
# * Storage Access Tiers 
#
# - Hot   : For those data accessed on daily basis, it has moderate cost for both read and write 
# - Cool  : For those data which are accessed very less, but writes regularly, This incur high charge for retrival and lesss charge for storing
# - Archive : This is where you can more data permenantly for long term retention and those data which you won't be accessing freequently and not needed them on immediate basis 
#

#                          Chapter 06 - Identity, Access and Security 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * What is identity 
# It can be a person, application or device trying to communicate over a network. 
# They notmally exchange password, keys etc to authnticate 
# 
# * Azure AD
# An identity as a service provided by Microsoft which helps to enable authtication.
# It offers support for below authitication methods 
# - SAML
# - OpenID
# - WS Federation 
#
# Below are few benifits of using Azure AD 
#
# - Security and wealth of bug fix already to protect against hackers 
# - Developer do not need to worry about the autheication and authorization
# - Centralized admisnitration for all application in your environment 
# - SSO for accessing all services and application hosted and updated with Azure AD
# - Integration with other Azure azure services such as storage account, database etc 
#
# * Difference between Authentication & Authorization 
#
# Authentication : Process of user proving who he is by providing user ID and password to login
# Authorization  : Process of granting access to that user based on his group membership and access levels 
# 
# * Conditional Access 
# Conditional access helps you to authenticate users based on their perimter such as office building, region, IP etc and also helps to track anamalies wih athengtication patterns 
# This allows to locl down access with additional checks such as sms, ms authicator app etc to verify the identity if the conditions do not meet for the user
#
# * Multi Factor Authentication 
# Below are few of the multi factor authenticaiton which you have 
#
# - SMS 
# - Email
# - MS authenticator App
# - Phone Call 
#
# * Password less authentication 
# There are few options Azure AD provides for multi factor authntication such as 
#
# - Finger print from specific registered device 
# - Facial recognition from specific registered device 
# - Some number exchage with MS auth app 
#
# * Role Based authentication 
# This is the microsoft preferred mode of authentication 
# Below are the default roles available in Azure AD, you can also create your own custom roles 
#
# - Reader
# - Contributor
# - Owner 
#
# * Zero Trust Methodology 
#
# - Verify Explicitly 
# - Least Privilaged
# - Assume there is breach and design accordingly
# - JIT - Just in time access, access granted only when they request access 
# - JEA - Just Enough access
# - Device - Ensure devices are running with the latest pathes and security fixes 
# - Monitoring - Detect and block events, hacks etc 
#
# * Defender for Cloud
# Helps to protect your services from all security related threats. 
# - This continously learn and assess your resources against the latest security postures being reported 
# - It also provides recomendation and takes actions to protect resources against those postures 
# - Can also helps to alert on the security incidents 
#
# There is a charge for each resources you want to protect, this can also use to protect resources in Google cloud and AWS

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Role based access control can be used to assign permission to Users, Groups, Applications 
#
# The scope of the role assignment can be Subscription, Resource group, Single resource 
#
# * Security Principal in Azure 
# - User 			: Single user in azure AD 
# - Group 		: Multiple users are assigned to a group, roles assigned to a user will impact all users 
# - Service Principal 	: A service principal is security ID for application or services
# - Managed Identity 	: This helps to avoid credentaials and allows to authenticate with client and object ID 
#
# Roles 
# - Owner 		: Has full control and can grant access to resources 
# - Contributer 	: Can create or manage all resources, can't grant access 
# - Reader 		: Can view existing resources 
# - User access Admin 	: Can only manage users 
#
# Note : There are lot more built in role in Azure which can be referenced below. 
# - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles
#
# Deny Assignments 
# - Blocks users from performing spcific actions even if a role assignment allows it
# - Created and managed in azure to protect resources 
# - Can only be created using Azure Blue Prints or manged apps
