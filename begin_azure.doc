#                          Chapter 01 - Describe Cloud Computing 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * What is Cloud Computing 
# Cloud computing is the delivery of services including compute, storage, database, networking, software, analytics and intelligence over the internet. 
# This makes the resource and compute availbility faster and you are paying only for what you use. 
# This way you will need to look into only your application and business problem to solve and cloud provider will look after arranging the resources and compute power needed for their customer. 
#
# * Different types of infrastructure hosting models 
# Below are the types infrastructure hosting services available and responsilbity is mentioned below 
#
# - On-Prem : In this model customer takes heavy lifting of managing everything required for an application to be run by hilself.
#   Customer Responsibility : Datacenter, hardware or servers, operating system, networking, storage, network security,i application, user authentication & Governance, information & data 
#
# - IAAS    : A virtualized computing environment devliverd by provider which can have serevsr, network and software 
#   Cloud provider : Datacenter, hardware or servers, storage, networking
#   Customer       : Operating system, application, network security, user authentication and Governance, information & data
#
# - PAAS    : A computing platform whic contains operating system and all other underlying services to host an application by a provider. 
#   Cloud Provider : Datacenter, hardware or servers, storage, networking, operating system
#   Customer       : Application, network security, user authtication & Goverannce, information & data
#
# - SAAS    : An application delivered over the internet by a provider. 
#   Cloud Provider : Datacenter, hardware or servers, storage, networking, network security, operating system, application 
#   Customer       : User Authentication and Governance, information and data 
#
# * Different types of cloud
# There are mainly three types of cloud services available 
#
# - Private Cloud : This is the service offered over internet or private network which is not open for general public. 
# - Public Cloud  : This is the service offered over the internet whis is publically accessible for anyone who want to purchase them. 
# - Hybrid Cloud  : A cloud that combines public and private cloud together by technology and also allows data and application to be shared between them.
#
# * Cloud pricing 
# Cloud pricing can vary based on different things such as 
# - Operational Cost 
# - Storage Cost 
# - backup Cost 
# - network (input and output)
# - logs & monitor
# - many other facts 
#
# * Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
# TCO is the total cost of running the service which includes the cost of purchase of servers, software, service to operate cost such as data center, utility bill and employee salary 
#
# * How to reduce cost in Cloud 
# - autoscaling 
#

#                          Chapter 02 - Azure Architectural Components
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * Regions  & Availability zones
# Region is a group of data centers deployed in multiple avilability zones within a single geographical location. 
# Azure offers more than 60 region world wide and it is the largest cloud provider by most number of regions 
# Each region will have a minimum 3 AZs inter connected with high performance network with round trip less than 2ms. 
#
# More Details : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview
#
# * Region pair & Cross region replication
# To recover customer data and service from multiple AZ or a wider region outage Azure provides a cross region replication architecture. 
# Some services use cross region replication by default using the advantage of services like Azure geo-redudant storage ()GRS) etc. 
# But some services do not have the cross region replication model available, in that case customer must build services to enable cross region replication. 
# To enable cross region replication azure uses regional replication pairs, please go through below link to understand more about the cross region replication and region pais 
#
# Reference : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure
#
# * Sovereign Regions 
# Certain regions are dedicated to specific soverign entities. Although all regions are azure, these soverign regions are isolated from other azure regions. 
# These regions are not necessarily managed by Microsoft, they may be restricted to certain customers. 
#
# Example - China, US Goverment 
#
# * Resources 
# Any virtual machines, storage, network, database or any other component helps to host your service running is a resource in azure 
#
#
# * Resource Groups
# Resource Groups are logical collection of resources which are similar in nature, You can have resources from multiple regions to be part of the same resource group. 
# For data privacy reasons data for the resource group has to be in specific region. 
# You have have virtual machine, storage, network, lb and data base etc as part of the same resource group 
#
# * Subscription 
# subscription logically associate user accounts with the resources that they create. 
# Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources that it can create and use. 
# Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, and projects.
# Subscriptions the way to manage billing, you can have one subscription or more than one based on your requirement for your company. 
# All resources consumed by a subscription will be billed by the owner of the subscription. 
# For example you can create subscription by environments like dev, test and prod or create with respect to teams, line of business or according to clients 
#
# Reference : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-an-azure-account/4-multiple-subscriptions
#
# * Management Group 
# Azure management groups are a way to organize subscriptions, it helps you to organize subscriptions and apply controls and governance on them. 
# All subscriptions under the management group will inherit the controls applied to the management group. 
# You can also have nested management groups under one another to have controls applied in various levels 
#
# Reference : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/azure-management-groups-now-in-general-availability/
#
# * Azure Management level and Heirarchy 
#
#              	   	          Management Group
#                       	        |
#    	         Subscription 1         |         Subscription 2

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * Compute Services in Azure and their AWS similar service 
#
# - Virtual machines 		(EC2)
# - VM scale Sets    		(Auto Scaling) 		: Supports upto 100 VM by default and can be increased upto 1000 VMs
# - App Services     		(Elastic Bean stalk)    : PaaS
# - Azure Container Instances 	(fargate)			: 
# - Azure Kubernetes Services 	(EKS)
# - Windows Virtual Desktop  
# - Azure Functions             (lambda)
#
# Refer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree
#
#
# * Network Service 
#
# - Virual Network(VNet)	(VPC)
# - Subnet			(Subnet)
# - VPN gateway 		(VPN Gateway)
# - Vnet Peering 		(VPC Peering)		: Helps to connect Vnet to communicate each other, if you are trying to connect between VNet from one region to other region it will cost high
# - Express Route 		(Direct Connect)
# - DNS Service 		(Route 53)
# - Load Balancer               
# - Application gateway 
# - Content Delivery Network 
# - Azure Front Door Service 
#  
#  Refer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview
#
# * Network Security Services 
# 
# - DDos Protection
# - Azure Firewall 
# - Network Security group
# - Private Link
#
# * Public and Private endpoints
# Azure provides both Public endpoint and private endpoint options. 
# 
# Public endpoints gives mainly three options 
# - Allow access from everywhere in network 
# - Allow access from specific Vnet 
# - Disable Public Access and use Private endpoint 
#
# Private endpoints are created to securely enable a connection between one endpoint to another endpoints, so that resources can communicate each other in a 1:1 routing. 
# A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. 
# This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service that's powered by Azure Private Link. 
# By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.
#
# Refer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview

#                          Chapter 04 - Azure Storage  
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Azure has several storage options, starting from object storage BLOB to NAS and SAN, please find the details below. 
#
# * Azure Storage Accounts
# Storage accounts has mainly 4 options 
# - Azure Blobs container : This is the object storage like S3 in AWS which accessible via HTTP / HTTPS across the globe
# - Azure Files 	  : used for managed fils shares using SMB / NFS protocol / Azure Files REST API which is accessible from across the world.
# - Queue Storage : This is the Queue service like aws SQS used for passing anynchrouns message between azure services. 
# - Table Storage : Table storage is part of the Azure Cosmos DB which is available for hosting No SQL database use cases
#
# * Other Storage Types
# - Disk Storage  : This is block storage which can be used to store data in a VM which do not need to be accessed central from multiple services 
# - Azure Netapp  : Azure netapp files is used for high performance storage requirements where NAS can be used 
# - Azure Elastic SAN 	 : This is used for large scale data requirement which required high intenisty IO operation with the cloud HA and reliability. 
#
# * Storage authorization options 
#
# Azure provided below aithorization services to access the storage accounts 
#
# - Azure active directory (Azure AD) integration for blobs, queues and table data. 
# - Azure AD authorization over SMB for Azure files 
# - Authorization with Shared Key 
# - Authorization using shared access signature (SAS)
# - Active Dirctory domain servies with Azure netApp Files 
#
# Also it offers below encryption options 
#
# - Encyption at rest 
# You can use either microsoft managed keys (MMK) customer managed keys (CMK)
#
# * Storage Access Tiers 
#
# - Hot   : For those data accessed on daily basis, it has moderate cost for both read and write 
# - Cool  : For those data which are accessed very less, but writes regularly, This incur high charge for retrival and lesss charge for storing
# - Archive : This is where you can more data permenantly for long term retention and those data which you won't be accessing freequently and not needed them on immediate basis 
#
# Performance Tiers
#
# - Standard  : Normal IOPS
# - Premium   : Higher IOPS 
#
# * Replication 
#
# - LRS : Locally available storage replication within DC, cheapest option which suitable for low cost apps 
# - GRS : Geo Redudant storage, Intermediate option wit failover capabilities with a second region, recomend for backup scenarios 
# - ZRS : Zone redudant storage, Intermediate option suitable for HA scenarios 
# - GZRS : GEO and Zone redudant storage, Suitable for optimal data protection, suitable for critical data options 
#
# Location : primary region replication or cross region replication 
#
# Refer : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction
#
# * azopy 
#
# azopy is the deafult option for copying data between storage accounts, you can generate a SAS token and then use the url based on the SAS token to copy the data 
#
# Syntax : azcopy copy {blob_container_Source_file_SAS_url} {Destination_blob_container_SAS_url}
#
# NOTE : make sure yoyu create the SAS token for each set
#
# Example : 
#
# | azcopy copy 'https://sathsangblob.blob.core.windows.net/my-first-bucket-in-a2XXX02022-12-06%20at%2021.46.48.jpeg?sp=xxxxxxx 'https://sathsang02.blob.core.windows.net/destination-copy?sp=xxxxx'
