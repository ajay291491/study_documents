# * What is Machine Learning
# A subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the design of systems that can learn from and make decisions and 
# predictions based on data. Machine learning enables computers to act and make data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed to 
# carry out a certain task. Machine Learning programs are also designed to learn and improve over time when exposed to new data. 
# Machine learning has been at the center of many technological advancements in recent years such as self-driving cars, computer vision and speech recognition systems.
#
# * Supervised Learning
# Where a program is “trained” on a pre-defined dataset. Based off its training data the program can make accurate decisions when given new data. 
# Example: Using a training set of human tagged positive, negative and neutral tweets to train a sentiment analysis classifier.
#
# * Un Supervised Learning 
# Where Program given dataset can automatically find pateterns and relationship in that dataset 
# Example : Analyzing a data set of emails which group related email without prior knowledge of the data, this is also known as practicing or clustering
#
# * Classification
# This is a sub catagory of supervised learning, classification is the process of taking some sort of input and assigning a label to it.
# CLassification systems are normally used for when predictions are of descrete or yes or no type.
# Example : Mapping a picture of someone to a male or female. 
#
# * Regression 
# Regression is a method in machine learning which helps to predict the value of a continous predicting variable (Y) based on one or multiple variables (X).
# Example : One of the example for regression is predicting house prices bassed on various dependant variables such as size, area, community etc 
#
# * Decission Tree 
# This is a way of visually representing the decission making process with tree like graph by explaining the tree like process and consiquence.

#
# * Deep Learning 
# Deep learning refers to a catagory of machine learning algorithms that often uses artificial nueral networks or a network interconnected model which 
# makes up a model. Nowadays deep learning techniques are very hot and and successful in solving image recognition problems due to their ability to 
# pick up the best features.
