#
# * What is Machine Learning
# A subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the design of systems that can learn from and make decisions and 
# predictions based on data. Machine learning enables computers to act and make data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed to 
# carry out a certain task. Machine Learning programs are also designed to learn and improve over time when exposed to new data. 
# Machine learning has been at the center of many technological advancements in recent years such as self-driving cars, computer vision and speech recognition systems.
#
# * Supervised Learning
# Where a program is “trained” on a pre-defined dataset. Based off its training data the program can make accurate decisions when given new data. 
# Example: Using a training set of human tagged positive, negative and neutral tweets to train a sentiment analysis classifier.
#
# * Un Supervised Learning 
# Where Program given dataset can automatically find pateterns and relationship in that dataset 
# Example : Analyzing a data set of emails which group related email without prior knowledge of the data, this is also known as practicing or clustering
#
# * Classification
# This is a sub catagory of supervised learning, classification is the process of taking some sort of input and assigning a label to it.
# CLassification systems are normally used for when predictions are of descrete or yes or no type.
# Example : Mapping a picture of someone to a male or female. 
#
# * Regression 
# Regression is a method in machine learning which helps to predict the value of a continous predicting variable (Y) based on one or multiple variables (X).
# Example : One of the example for regression is predicting house prices bassed on various dependant variables such as size, area, community etc 
#
# * Decission Tree 
# This is a way of visually representing the decission making process with tree like graph by explaining the tree like process and consiquence.

#
# * Deep Learning 
# Deep learning refers to a catagory of machine learning algorithms that often uses artificial nueral networks or a network interconnected model which 
# makes up a model. Nowadays deep learning techniques are very hot and and successful in solving image recognition problems due to their ability to 
# pick up the best features.

#
# * Notations
# When you are dealing with machine learning You should know how you represent your data and how will you understand when they represent 
# To start the discussion, below is a sample given 
#
# Input Data  |  Hypothesis |  Output Value 
# --------------------------------------------
#    1024     | {Algorithm} |     1 MB
#    2048     | {Algorithm} |     2 MB
#    4096     | {Algorithm} |     4 MB
#
# m 	: This represents the total number of examples, here its 3
# x(i) 	: This represents the i'th Input data, lets assume x(2) then the value it represent is 2048
# y(i)	: This represents the i'th output value, lets assume y(3) then the value it represent is 4 MB
# h		: This represents the algorithem or function which takes the input data (x) and predict the output value (y)
#
# * Hypothesis 
# Hypothesis is the function that is to be learnt by the learning algorithm by the training progress for making the predictions about the unseen data.
# 
# For example, for Linear Regression in One Variable or Univariate Linear Regression, the hypothesis, h is given by
# hθ(x)=θ0 + θ1 x
#
# . hθ(x) is the hypothesis function, also denoted as h(x) sometimes 
# . x  is the independent variable
# . θ 0  and θ 1  are the parameters of the linear regression that need to be learn
