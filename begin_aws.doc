#		Chapter 01 - Introduction and Key terms
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * What is an Availability Zone 
# An availability zone is a one or more than one data centers in one city or place. Together an availbity zone zone make sure the availability of services for that zone
# Examples : us-east-1a
#
# * What is a Region
# Region is a group of availability zones, this might me with respect to one country or a state. 
# Examples : Singapore, Sydney, Ohio 
#
# * Edge Location 
# Its a content delivery network (CDN), its a caching point from where users can download their data locally. 
# For example, if someone from Singapore trying to access a file location USA, then the edge location within Singapore will help to provide the caching content. 
#
# * Scope of AWS certified solution architect

#		Chapter 02 - Identity and Access Management (IAM) 101 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * What is IAM 
# IAM will help you to administer you accounts and groups in AWS. This is very important in managing AWS.
# It has mainly few components as below, 
#
# - User	: This is an end user
# - Group	: COllection of users
# - Policy	: These are set of rules which defines a user or group should have what level of access, these are represented in Json format
# - Roles 	: Roles are created mainly for AWS resources such as EC2 or S3 etc to give permission to access other resources
#
# Note : IAM supports PCI cimpliance which is a payment card industry framework
#      : AWS IAM roles are held at the global level 
#
# * What is a root account 
# Root account is the account you have used to signed up into the AWS console, genrally this will be an email address. 
#
# * What is AWS console 
# This is single place where you can access all the AWS service. 
# My custom console : https://ajay291491.signin.aws.amazon.com/console 
#
# * Creating an user 
# Login to Console  -> Security, Identity and Compliance -> IAM -> Users -> Add User
# . Provide Username 
# . Provide group details 
# . Assign policies to the group 
# . Submit 
# . Download the CSV if needed. 
#
# * What is access key id and access secret
# Access key ID and secret are used to access an user account programatically, they are never used to login to the console.
# You can setup that by going to 
#
# Login to Console  -> Security, Identity and Compliance -> IAM -> Users -> Select user -> Select security Credentials 
#
# * What is Roles
# Roles are used to grant permission into your aws resource, you can create them by 
# Login to Console  -> Security, Identity and Compliance -> IAM -> Users -> Select Roles -> Create Roles 
#

#		Chapter 03 -  Simple Storege Services (S3)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# * What is S3
# S3 is one of the oldest AWS service available and it is an object storage which helps you store files and data. 
# S3 is an object storage an it cannot  be used for installing operating systems for that purpose you need look for another block storage. 
# S3 comes in various different flavours, according to the cost and requirements
#
# Key things to note about S3 
# - S3 is an object storage which help you to store only the files and data 
# - S3 bucket name should an unique name, because based on that name there will be a web url getting created to access the files. 
# - Bucket is the top level folder name in the S3 storage 
# - When you upload a file it will give a HTTP code 200 to mean its successful
# - S3 enables version controlling 
# - Its provides metadata (data about the data stored) to control the version control
# - S3 provides 99.99% availability and durability 
# - S3 provides different tiers in the storage 
# - S3 provides encryption 
# - You can store data upto 5 TB
# - This is an unlimited storage 
# - bucket namespace should be universal 
# - You can use the ACl to control the resource 
#
# Reading and writing to S3 
# - When you create a object it will be available immediately 
# - When you PUT of UPDATE an obeject in S3, it will take couple of seconds to get it updated 
#
# * S3 - Different Tiers
# There are different tiers of storage available in S3
#
# - S3 : Standard 
#   . It offers 99.99% availability 
#   . It offers 99.99999999999% durability 
#   . It is stored redudantly accross multiple devices in multiple fascilities. 
#   . It can sustain the loss of 2 fascilities together 
#
# - S3 : Standard IA
#   . This is designed for accessing the highly redudant data which gets accessed in-frequently
#   . But this gets charges for everytime when you access the data 
#
# - S3 : One zone IA
#   . Compare to Stadard 1A this is limited to only one availablity zones 
#   . Data is less redudant compare to the above 
#
# - S3 : Intelligent tiering 
#   . This is a new feature which uses Machine learning 
#   . This automatically map your data to the right tier according to the access of the data

#
# * S3 - Glacier (data archival solutions)
# S3 Glacier is a cheaper and reliable storage service which you can use to storage the data which you want to keep it for a long time. 
# You can say your legal documents which need to access only times when needed can be put in here. 
# There are two types of S3 glacier available. 
#
# - S3 : Glacier
#   . Secure, durable low cost solution for data archival 
#   . You can store any amount of data which will be cheaper than on-premisis data 
#   . retrival time can be configurable from minutes to hours 
#
# - S3 : Glacier Deep Archive 
#   . This is the cheapest available 
#   . Data retrival can take upto 12 hours

#		Chapter 05 -  Database
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Amazon has various different promises when it comes to database, based on the customer needs they can request for right solution 
# It also provides a fascility of read replicas which can allow you to read the database from a seperate node from write, which can be used for high read intense applications
# Major type of database available are 
#
# * RDS (Relation Database system)
# These are database running on virtual machines, however customer won't be having access to RDS. 
# Any patching and maintanance of RDS is taken care by Amazon itself. 
# Below are ket RDS promises available 
# - MySql 
# - SQL 
# - Oracle 
# - PostgresQL
# - MariaDB
#
# * Aurora 
# This is a relational database system which provided by Amazon and it runs on a serverless architecture. 
#
# * Dynamo DB (NoSQL)
# This ia a no SQL Db which provided by AWS. 
# This will help you to store multi dimensional data outside the traditional SQL Db which relies only on rown and columns model 
#
# * Elastic Cache 
# These are the caching technologies available in AWS, there are mainly two of them 
# - Memcahe  : This can be used for small application require less amount of caching 
# - Redis    : This can be used for caching on larger data for long hours 
#
# * Redshift
# This is a data warehousing technology provided by Amazon. 
# This is used for business intelligence and available only on one availability zone. 
# This can have a copy of the backup on the S3 storage 
#
#

#		Chapter 06 - Route 53 (DNS)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In AWS DNS and loadbalancing technologies are termed as Route 53. 
# There are mainly 6 load balancing technologies available in AWS 
#
# 1. Sample Routing        : This is a round robin based routing and we cannot associate health check with this 
# 2. Weighed Routing       : Here you can specify how much percentage traffic you want to keep this to one IP over another
# 3. Latency Based routing : Here routing will be based on the latency you experience between multiple IPs
# 4. Region based routing  : This will help you to route the traffic based on the region 
# 5. Failover Routing      : This can be used in case for auto failover incase the service is not available for any IPs
# 6. Multi Value Routing   : This is similar to the simple routing with health check 
#
# NOTE : Most of the above routing you can associate with the a health check.
#      : In the health check you can associate a service or port and you can request to keep monitor it for any failure to redirect traffic based on that 
#
