#		Chapter 01 - Introduction and Key terms
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * What is an Availability Zone 
# An availability zone is a one or more than one data centers in one city or place. Together an availbity zone zone make sure the availability of services for that zone
# Examples : us-east-1a
#
# * What is a Region
# Region is a group of availability zones, this might me with respect to one country or a state. 
# Examples : Singapore, Sydney, Ohio 
#
# * Edge Location 
# Its a content delivery network (CDN), its a caching point from where users can download their data locally. 
# For example, if someone from Singapore trying to access a file location USA, then the edge location within Singapore will help to provide the caching content. 
#
# * Scope of AWS certified solution architect 
# - Compute 
# - Storage 
# - Database
# - Network and Content Delivery
# - Security Identity & Compliance 
#
# * Installing AWS CLI
# Install aws cli using your favorite package and then configure the AWS cli using the keys

#		Chapter 02 - Identity and Access Management (IAM) 101 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * What is IAM 
# IAM will help you to administer you accounts and groups in AWS. This is very important in managing AWS.
# It has mainly few components as below, 
#
# - User	: This is an end user
# - Group	: COllection of users
# - Policy	: These are set of rules which defines what level of access and actions can be performed, these are represented in Json format
# - Roles 	: Roles are created mainly for AWS resources to give permission to access other resources for exampe, role for EC2 to access S3
#
# Note : IAM supports PCI compliance which is a payment card industry framework
#      : AWS IAM roles are held at the global level
#
# * What is a root account 
# Root account is the account you have used to signed up into the AWS console, genrally this will be an email address. 
#
# * What is AWS console 
# This is single place where you can access all the AWS service. 
# My custom console : https://ajay291491.signin.aws.amazon.com/console 
#
# * Creating an user 
# Login to Console  -> Security, Identity and Compliance -> IAM -> Users -> Add User
# . Provide Username 
# . Provide group details 
# . Assign policies to the group 
# . Submit 
# . Download the CSV if needed. 
#
# * What is access key id and access secret
# Access key ID and secret are used to access an user account programatically, they are never used to login to the console.
# You can setup that by going to 
#
# Login to Console  -> Security, Identity and Compliance -> IAM -> Users -> Select user -> Select security Credentials 
#
# * What is Roles
# Roles are used to grant permission for one AWS resource to another.
# For example an EC2 resource want access to an S3 storage then its going to be perimitted via roles
# Roles will always have some attached policies which will in fact provide the actual permission to the resource when it gets allocated.
# Login to Console  -> Security, Identity and Compliance -> IAM -> Users -> Select Roles -> Create Roles 
#
# * Billing Alarm 
# Billing alarm can be useful to get notification during the usage. 
# There are various different options in billing available, to enable billing you will need to do folowing 
#
# Login to Console -> Select 'My Account' -> ' My billing Dashboard' -> Billing Preferences -> Receive Billing Alerts 
#
# Once you have enabled billing preference, then you will need to go to "Billing Dashboard" in could watch to setup your alerts 
#
# Login to Console -> Services -> Cloud Watch -> Bills -> Create alarm
#
#  * What is a policy
# Policy is something which tells whether a user has a permission to a resource or not, Policies are normally defined in the JSON language.
# Once the policies are defined and published then they can be attached to groups or users to grant defined permission to the end users.
# Policies are mainly defined into two different catagories they are
#
# - Managed policies  : These policies are managed and defined by Amazon
# - Inline Policy     : These are on-off policies defined for specific or custom purpose which can attached to users or groups
#
# Example : Below is an example for a policy
#
# |{
# |  "Version": "2012-10-17",
# |  "Statement": [
# |    {
# |      "Action": [                    --> Type of action in the policy
# |        "ec2:Describe*",
# |        "ec2:StartInstances",
# |        "ec2:StopInstances"
# |      ],
# |      "Resource": "*",
# |      "Effect": "Allow"              --> Action can be allow or denied
# |    },
# |    {
# |      "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
# |      "Resource": "*",
# |      "Effect": "Allow"
# |    },
# |    {
# |      "Action": [
# |        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
# |        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
# |        "cloudwatch:Describe*"
# |      ],
# |      "Resource": "*",
# |      "Effect": "Allow"
# |    },
# |    {
# |      "Action": "autoscaling:Describe*",
# |      "Resource": "*",
# |      "Effect": "Allow"
# |    }
# |  ]
# |}
#
# * What is ARN Name in AWS
# ARN is the amazon resource name which helps to identify the resource uniquely in AWS.
# Every resource in AWS has ARN name and its has a standard format
#
# Syntax : arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id
#          arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id
#          arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id
#
# Examples : Below are examples for ARN
#
# | arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Development/product_1234/*
# | Resource":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/*
# | Resource":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/*
# | arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket/*
# | arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket/Development/*
#

#		Chapter 03 -  Simple Storege Services (S3)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# * What is S3
# S3 is one of the oldest AWS service available and it is an object storage which helps you store files and data. 
# S3 is an object storage an it cannot  be used for installing operating systems for that purpose you need look for another block storage. 
# S3 comes in various different flavours, according to the cost and requirements
#
# * What is Object storage means for S3
# S3 or Simple storage service is called as an object storage which allows you to store files
# The reason it is called as an object is storage is because it consist of
#
# Key          : This represents the name of the object 
# Value        : This is simply the data and its made up of sequance of bytes on the disk)
# version ID   : This is helpful for versioning the data and helpful for identifying the version and its copies 
# MetaData     : Its the data about the data you are storing
# Subresources : Access control list of S3 
#
# * Key Fatures about S3 
# - S3 is an object storage which help you to store only the files and data 
# - S3 bucket name should an unique name, because based on that name there will be a web url getting created to access the files. 
# - Bucket is the top level folder name in the S3 storage 
# - When you upload a file it will give a HTTP code 200 to mean its successful
# - S3 enables version controlling 
# - Its provides metadata (data about the data stored) to control the version control
# - S3 provides 99.99% availability and 99.99999999999% durability 
# - S3 provides different tiers in the storage 
# - S3 provides encryption 
# - You can store data upto 5 TB
# - This is an unlimited storage 
# - bucket namespace should be universal 
# - You can use the ACl to control the resource 
# 
# * What is S3 Lifecycle management 
# This allows you to perform certain action based on certain life cycle, couple of examples are 
# - Perform archive to S3 glacier after 30 days 
# - Move data to another S3 after 90 days etc 
#
# * Reading and writing to S3 
# - When you create a object it will be available immediately 
# - When you PUT of UPDATE an obeject in S3, it will take couple of seconds to get it updated 
#
# * S3 - Different Tiers
# There are different tiers of storage available in S3
#
# - S3 : Standard 
#   . It offers 99.99% availability 
#   . It offers 99.99999999999% durability (9 9s after .)
#   . It is stored redudantly accross multiple devices in multiple fascilities. 
#   . It can sustain the loss of 2 fascilities together 
#
# - S3 : Standard IA
#   . This is designed for accessing the highly redudant data which gets accessed in-frequently
#   . But this gets charges for everytime when you access the data 
#   . Cost lower than S3 Standard and charges apply for retrival
#
# - S3 : One zone IA
#   . Compare to Stadard 1A this is limited to only one availablity zones 
#   . Data is less redudant compare to the above 
#   . Cost is less than above two as your redudancy is limited to only one availability zone
#
# - S3 : Intelligent tiering 
#   . This is a new feature which uses Machine learning 
#   . This automatically map your data to the right tier according to the access of the data

#
# * S3 - Glacier (data archival solutions)
# S3 Glacier is a cheaper and reliable storage service which you can use to storage the data which you want to keep it for a long time. 
# You can say your legal documents which need to access only times when needed can be put in here. 
# There are two types of S3 glacier available. 
#
# - S3 : Glacier
#   . Secure, durable low cost solution for data archival 
#   . You can store any amount of data which will be cheaper than on-premisis data 
#   . retrival time can be configurable from minutes to hours 
#
# - S3 : Glacier Deep Archive 
#   . This is the cheapest available 
#   . Data retrival can take upto 12 hours

#
# * What is S3 Transfer accelaration 
# AWS S3 transfer accelation service enables customers to transfer files faster, safer and secure. 
# This takes advantages of the amazon's CloudFront Edge locations to accelrate the transfer. 
# This comes into effect mostly when you perform a cross region file replication or file transfer, i.e you are trying to upload file to US-East1 bucket from Sydney region
# When a data arrives at the Edge location then it gets transferred to main S3 bucket via the amazon backbone network. 
# This way customers will be able to get the transfered faster and securely. 
#
# * Pros and Cons of S3 
# 
# Pros
# - S3 is an object storage which allows to upload files 
# - File size can be from 0 to 5 TB
# - There is unlimited storage 
# - S3 uses universal namespacing, i.e when you create an S3 bucket you will need to create a unique bucket name 
# - You can enable MFA while deleting the object from S3 
# - While uploading a file you will get HTTP status code 200
#
# Cons 
# - You cannot install operating system on the S3 bucket 
# - You cannot install database on the S3 bucket 
#
# NOTE : S3 is a major portion of the exam and You need to reas 'S3 Faq' for more details .

# Chapter 05 -  Database
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Amazon has various different promises when it comes to database, based on the customer needs they can request for right solution 
# It also provides a fascility of read replicas which can allow you to read the database from a seperate node from write, which can be used for high read intense applications
# Major type of database available are 
#
# * RDS (Relation Database system)
# These are database running on virtual machines, however customer won't be having access to RDS. 
# Any patching and maintanance of RDS is taken care by Amazon itself. 
# Below are ket RDS promises available 
# - MySql 
# - SQL 
# - Oracle 
# - PostgresQL
# - MariaDB
#
# * Aurora 
# This is a relational database system which provided by Amazon and it runs on a serverless architecture. 
#
# * Dynamo DB (NoSQL)
# This ia a no SQL Db which provided by AWS. 
# This will help you to store multi dimensional data outside the traditional SQL Db which relies only on rown and columns model 
#
# * Elastic Cache 
# These are the caching technologies available in AWS, there are mainly two of them 
# - Memcahe  : This can be used for small application require less amount of caching 
# - Redis    : This can be used for caching on larger data for long hours 
#
# * Redshift
# This is a data warehousing technology provided by Amazon. 
# This is used for business intelligence and available only on one availability zone. 
# This can have a copy of the backup on the S3 storage 
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#		Chapter 06 - Route 53 (DNS)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In AWS DNS and loadbalancing technologies are termed as Route 53. 
# There are mainly 6 load balancing technologies available in AWS 
#
# 1. Sample Routing        : This is a round robin based routing and we cannot associate health check with this 
# 2. Weighed Routing       : Here you can specify how much percentage traffic you want to keep this to one IP over another
# 3. Latency Based routing : Here routing will be based on the latency you experience between multiple IPs
# 4. Region based routing  : This will help you to route the traffic based on the region 
# 5. Failover Routing      : This can be used in case for auto failover incase the service is not available for any IPs
# 6. Multi Value Routing   : This is similar to the simple routing with health check 
#
# NOTE : Most of the above routing you can associate with the a health check.
#      : In the health check you can associate a service or port and you can request to keep monitor it for any failure to redirect traffic based on that 
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#		Chapter 07 - VPC
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VPC is a virtual isolation layer of resources in AWS. If you create an account there will be a default VPC attached with it.
# A VPC mainly has many components with in it which control the resource access. Few of the key components you should be aware are 
#
# - Internet Gateway : Using this component any resource in the VPC can reach from inside or outside to internet
# - Subnet           : This is the subnet which decides network isolation with in a VPC, you can have more than one subnet in VPC
# - NACL (Network Access control list) : This decides the access controls like which IP and port can access resource on what subnets etc.
# - Routing Table    : Similar to Unix routing this decides from where to where the network should be routed
# 
# Below are the few key specialities of VPC 
# - They are highly available 
# - They are highly redudant 
# - Bydefault one Internet Gateway will be attached to VPC, you can have multiple IGW but only one can be attached
# - You cannot delete a VPC if there are resource in that VPC.
#
# * Routing Table
# This does the routing between network IPs which help in determining the source and destination
# Below are few key things you need to note about routing table 
# - When you create a VPC there will be two route table configured by defaul, one "local" which determines local traffic with in VPC
# - Second route will be to the IGW this will dtermine the traffic to the internet gateway
# - By default the route table to internet gateway will be 0.0.0.0/*, which means any resource can access IGW.
#
# * Internetgateway
# IGW is the way for any resource to connect to internet.
# - There can be only one IGW which can be attached to a VPC
# - Routing to the IGW can be done through the route table 
# - IGW has two states which is "attached" and "detached". On a detached state this will communicate with inetrnet through there are routes
#
# * Network ACL
# This is an optional layer which control the access to VPC like a firewall. 
# - There will be 6 subnets created when there will be a VPC gets created.
# - One NACL will act as a firewall for all the 6 subnets associated with the VPC
# - You can have the Inbound rules which tell what external resource can access VPC with what port number
# - You can have outbound rules which tells what source can send traffic via what port
# - NACL always have a number, rules are processed in lowest order, which means lowest ACL rule will override if there are duplicate
#
