    "#### What is Machine Learning ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the design of systems that can learn from and make decisions and predictions based on data. Machine learning enables computers to act and make data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed to carry out a certain task. Machine Learning programs are also designed to learn and improve over time when exposed to new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has been at the center of many technological advancements in recent years such as self-driving cars, computer vision and speech recognition systems."
